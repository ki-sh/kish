Kish has grown to include some niffty features that deserve a bit more of an introduction.
This is akin to Oh my Zsh 'plugins', with the advantage that there is convention over configuration,
hence a very small amount of framework code.


## Kit - Kish Testing.

ok, so this info can go in cmd -h and markdown for online.

## Ocal - open calendar event creator

## Kin - Kish New code generator.

##Â utils

bash v3 has almost 100% support cross platform.
But it has some serious limitiations.
ki was built with it for portability.
You may find some of these utilities helpful if you
want to use bash v<4.
For example, essentials we take for granted in most languages arent there!:

how to get function chains returning data.
functions can only echo back a string and an integer error code.
How to return multiple variables.
