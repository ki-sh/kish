## make your own

My goal is to help developers share code more effectivly - aiming for zero friction actually.

customise, make your own aliases. Share with your team/organisation.

Configure commands with super powers.
Designed for mono/multi/poly repos.
Never have to type cd.. again.
Faster context/multi-project switching.

Designed for maximum flow and ease of use.
Opinionated: by default these types of actions run across multipe directories.
This is how we want to work - with multiple repository folders.
Going more specific is allowed: just add /. if you want to action task on
a single target.

99% of the time you want to do git actions on at least one entire repo.
in other ways folder  that is initialised for git.
so by setting applicable the command will only execute on folders containing .git folder.

kish allow you to avoid changing directory, type a lot less and so stay in the flow for 99% of git and yarn/npm/pnpm tasks.

Simple easily customisable toolbelt especially useful for
mono/multi/poly repos. Run packaging and git tasks like a Boss.
Allows you to get in the flow and do this chore stuff without having
to think about it super fast!
